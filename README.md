# Agentic-Stock-Price-Analysis
📈🔍 AI Meets the Stock Market — AAPL Analysis with Autonomous Agents 🤖💹

Excited to share my latest project:
“Agentic Stock Price Analysis with GPT-4o + AutoGen”

In this notebook, I combined:

🧠 AutoGen multi-agent collaboration (GroupChat, AssistantAgent, UserProxyAgent)

📊 Real-world data via yfinance

💬 GPT-4o from OpenAI for reasoning & report generation

🗂️ Secure environment using dotenv

The task?
➡️ Analyze Apple's (AAPL) stock closing prices over the past month
➡️ Generate an automated, intelligent summary report via agents
➡️ All done without manual intervention! 🤯

🧩 See the workflow and tech stack in the diagram below.
